# Certificate-Front-End

Certificate Generator aims to automatically generate certificates based on the data
provided using input files like csv and excel.

## Target Audience

```
 Certificate Issuing Organizations: The Certificate issuing organization will first
have to register themselves for authorization. They can generate multiple
certificates simply by selecting the template and giving the candidates details
through files like csv and excel.
```
```
 Candidates Receiving the Certificates: The Candidate's dashboard will contain
the URLs of all the certificated they have received. This will help them in
maintaining all the certificates even if they have lost them locally.
